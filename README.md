The API was deployed to Microsoft Azure and it's URL is:
https://testecinemaapi.azurewebsites.net/


I'm still learning how to document API's, but you can use the following Admin credentials to play with all CRUD http methods (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE), and create Users, Movies and Reservations.

Email: admini@email.com

Password: senha1234

Access token (just post this as an Authorization property on the Headers section inside of Postman): "bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImFkbWluaUBlbWFpbC5jb20iLCJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy54bWxzb2FwLm9yZy93cy8yMDA1LzA1L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9lbWFpbGFkZHJlc3MiOiJhZG1pbmlAZW1haWwuY29tIiwiaHR0cDovL3NjaGVtYXMubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS93cy8yMDA4LzA2L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9yb2xlIjoiQWRtaW4iLCJuYmYiOjE2MTY2MzU4NDMsImV4cCI6MTYxNjcyMjI0MywiaXNzIjoibG9jYWxob3N0LmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdC5jb20ifQ.e48P1nHm1nUNbLcx64vcBRbJrLcW7ReYw4da04s9T2s"

The database is only filled with users data, still didn't register any movies.

The Endpoints that can be accessed are:

-api/users/register (POST)

-api/users/login (POST)

-api/movies/3 (GET, PUT, DELETE)

-api/movies/


-- mano, eu esqueci os outros endpoints, mas vou procurar todos e postar aqui depois...
